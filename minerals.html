<h4>Graphite</h4> 
<p>Graphite is a naturally occurring form of crystalline carbon. It is a native element mineral found in 
metamorphic and igneous rocks. Graphite is a mineral of extremes. It is extremely soft, cleaves with very 
light pressure, and has a very low specific gravity. In contrast, it is extremely resistant to heat and 
nearly inert in contact with almost any other material. These extreme properties give it a wide range of 
uses in metallurgy and manufacturing.Graphite is a mineral that forms when carbon is subjected to heat and 
pressure in Earth's crust and in the upper mantle. Pressures in the range of 75,000 pounds per square inch 
and temperatures in the range of 750 degrees Celsius are needed to produce graphite. These correspond to 
the granulite metamorphic facies.Most of the graphite seen at Earth's surface today was formed at convergent
 plate boundaries where organic-rich shales and limestones were subjected to the heat and pressure of 
regional metamorphism. This produces marble, schist, and gneiss that contain tiny crystals and flakes of 
graphite. When graphite is in high enough concentrations, these rocks can be mined, crushed to a particle 
size that liberates the graphite flakes, and processed by specific gravity separation or froth flotation 
to remove the low-density graphite. The product produced is known as "flake graphite."Some graphite forms 
from the metamorphism of coal seams. The organic material in coal is composed mainly of carbon, oxygen, 
hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur. The heat of metamorphism destroys the organic molecules of coal, 
volatilizing the oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur. What remains is a nearly pure carbon material 
that crystallizes into mineral graphite.

<h4>Quartz</h4> 
<p>Quartz is one of the most well-known minerals on earth. It occurs in basically all mineral environments, 
and is the important constituent of many rocks. Quartz is also the most varied of all minerals, occurring 
in all different forms, habits, and colors. There are more variety names given to Quartz than any other 
mineral. Although the Feldspars as a group are more prevalent than Quartz, as an individual mineral Quartz 
is the most common mineral. Most mineral reference guides list Chalcedony as an individual mineral, but in 
reality it is a variety of Quartz. It is the microcrystalline form of Quartz, forming only occurs in 
microscopic, compacted crystals. This page deals only with the crystalline forms of Quartz. Chalcedony is 
listed on its own dedicated page in this guide. Other important varieties of Quartz, such as Amethyst, 
Citrine, and Agate, also have dedicated pages due to their popularity and individual varieties. Some forms 
of Quartz, especially the gemstone forms, have their color enhanced. Almost all forms of the yellow-brown 
variety Citrine are in fact heat treated. Much Amethyst is also heat treated to intensify color, and a green 
transparent form known as "Green Amethyst" or "Prasiolite" is formed by heat treating certain types of 
Amethyst. There is also a transparent sky blue form of Quartz crystals, as well as a wildly iridescent type 
that are synthetically colored by irradiation of gold. In some localities, Hematite forms a thin red or brown 
layer internally in the Quartz crystal, giving it a natural bright red to brown coloring, and sometimes even 
a mild natural iridescence. Quartz frequently forms the inner lining of geodes. Most geodes have an inner 
layer of larger crystalline Quartz, and an outer layer of Chalcedony or banded Agate.

<h4>Copper</h4> 
<p>Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29. It is a soft, 
malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. A freshly exposed surface 
of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a 
building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as sterling silver used in jewelry, 
cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins, and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples 
for temperature measurement. Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable 
metallic form (native metals). This led to very early human use in several regions, from circa 8000 BC. 
Thousands of years later, it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores, circa 5000 BC; the first 
metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC; and the first metal to be purposely alloyed with another 
metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 3500 BC. In the Roman era, copper was mined principally on Cyprus, the 
origin of the name of the metal, from aes cyprium (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to cuprum (Latin). 
Coper (Old English) and copper were derived from this, the later spelling first used around 1530. Commonly 
encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as 
azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. Copper used in 
buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in 
decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as 
bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.

<h4>Diamond</h4> 
<p>Diamond, a mineral composed of pure carbon. It is the hardest naturally occurring substance known; 
it is also the most popular gemstone. Because of their extreme hardness, diamonds have a number of 
important industrial applications.The hardness, brilliance, and sparkle of diamonds make them unsurpassed as
 gems. In the symbolism of gemstones, the diamond represents steadfast love and is the birthstone for April. 
 Diamond stones are weighed in carats (1 carat = 200 milligrams) and in points (1 point = 0.01 carat). 
 In addition to gem-quality stones, several varieties of industrial diamonds occur, and synthetic diamonds 
 have been produced on a commercial scale since 1960. See also industrial diamond; synthetic diamond. Diamonds 
 are found in three types of deposits: alluvial gravels, glacial tills, and kimberlite pipes. The kimberlite 
 pipes (such as those at Kimberley, South Africa) form from intrusions of magma into the Earthâ€™s crust and 
 deliver diamonds and other rocks and minerals from the mantle. The pipes themselves are often less than 100 
 million years old. However, the diamonds they carry were formed 1 to 3.3 billion years ago at depths of more 
 than about 75 miles (120 km). Diamonds found in alluvial and glacial gravels must have been released by 
 fluvial or glacial erosion of the kimberlite matrix and then redeposited in rivers or in glacial till.
