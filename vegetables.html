<h4>Carrot</h4> 
<p>The carrot is a root vegetable often claimed to be the perfect health food.
It is crunchy, tasty, and highly nutritious. Carrots are a particularly good source of beta 
carotene, fiber, vitamin K1, potassium, and antioxidants. They also have a number of health 
benefits. They’re a weight-loss-friendly food and have been linked to lower cholesterol levels 
and improved eye health. What’s more, their carotene antioxidants have been linked to a reduced 
risk of cancer. Carrots are found in many colors, including yellow, white, orange, red, and 
purple. Orange carrots get their bright color from beta carotene, an antioxidant that your body 
converts into vitamin A. Carrots are mainly composed of water and carbs. The carbs consist of 
starch and sugars, such as sucrose and glucose (1Trusted Source). They are also a relatively 
good source of fiber, with one medium-sized carrot (61 grams) providing 2 grams. Carrots often 
rank low on the glycemic index (GI), which is a measure of how quickly foods raise blood sugar 
after a meal.

<h4>Corn</h4> 
<p>
Corn was first domesticated by native peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. 
Modern corn is believed to have been derived from the Balsas teosinte, a wild grass. Its 
culture had spread as far north as southern Maine by the time of European settlement of North 
America, and Native Americans taught European colonists to grow the indigenous grains. Since 
its introduction into Europe by Christopher Columbus and other explorers and colonizers, corn 
has spread to all areas of the world suitable to its cultivation. It is grown from 58° N 
latitude in Canada and Russia to 40° S latitude in South America, with a corn crop maturing 
somewhere in the world nearly every month of the year. It is the most important crop in the 
United States and is a staple food in many places. Corn is one of the world’s most productive 
and dominant crops. It is grown extensively as food for both humans and livestock, as a biofuel, 
and as a crude material in industry.Corn is the third largest plant-based food source in the world.
 Despite its importance as a major food in many parts of the world, corn is inferior to other 
 cereals in nutritional value. Its protein is of poor quality, and it is deficient in niacin. 
 Diets in which it predominates often result in pellagra. Corn is high in dietary fibre and 
 rich in antioxidants.

<h4>Chili Pepper</h4> 
<p>Chili peppers, are varieties of the berry-fruit of plants from the genus Capsicum, which are 
members of the nightshade family Solanaceae, cultivated for their pungency. Chili peppers are 
widely used in many cuisines as a spice to add "heat" to dishes. Chili pepper pods are technically
 berries. When used fresh, they are most often prepared and eaten like a vegetable. Whole pods 
 can be dried and then crushed or ground into chili powder that is used as a spice or seasoning. 
 Chilies can be dried to prolong their shelf life. Chili peppers can also be preserved by brining, 
 immersing the pods in oil, or by pickling. Chili peppers originated in Bolivia and were first 
 cultivated in Mexico. After the Columbian Exchange, many cultivars of chili pepper 
spread around the world, used for both food and traditional medicine. This led to a wide variety 
of cultivars, including the annuum species, with its glabriusculum variety and New Mexico cultivar 
group, and the species of baccatum, chinense, frutescens, and pubescens. Cultivars grown in North 
America and Europe are believed to all derive from Capsicum annuum, and have white, yellow, red or 
purple to black fruits. In 2019, the world's production of raw green chili peppers amounted to 38 
million tons, with China producing half.

<h4>Tamato</h4> 
<p>
The wild species originated in the Andes Mountains of South America, probably mainly in Peru and Ecuador, 
and is thought to have been domesticated in pre-Columbian Mexico; its name is derived from the Náhuatl (Aztec) 
word tomatl. The tomato was introduced to Europe by the Spanish in the early 16th century, and the Spanish and 
Italians seem to have been the first Europeans to adopt it as a food. In France and northern Europe the tomato 
was initially grown as an ornamental plant and was regarded with suspicion as a food because botanists recognized 
it as a relative of the poisonous belladonna and deadly nightshade. Indeed, the roots and leaves of the tomato plant 
are poisonous and contain the neurotoxin solanine. The Italians called the tomato pomodoro (“golden apple”), 
which has given rise to speculation that the first tomatoes known to Europeans were yellow. It has been suggested 
that the French called it pomme d’amour (“love apple”) because it was thought to have aphrodisiacal properties. 
Some scholars assert, however, that the tomato was at first taken to be a kind of eggplant, of which it is a close 
relative. The eggplant was called pomme des Mours (“apple of the Moors”) because it was a favourite vegetable of t
he Arabs, and pomodoro and pomme d’amour may be corruptions of that name.
