<h4>Bird</h4> 
<p>Birds are vertebrate animals adapted for flight. Many can also run, jump, swim, and dive.
Some, like penguins, have lost the ability to fly but retained their wings. Birds are found
worldwide and in all habitats. The largest is the nine-foot-tall ostrich. The smallest is 
the two-inch-long bee hummingbird.Everything about the anatomy of a bird reflects its ability to fly. 
The wings, for example, are shaped to create lift. The leading edge is thicker than the back edge, 
and they are covered in feathers that narrow to a point. Airplane wings are modeled after bird wings.
The bones and muscles of the wing are also highly specialized. The main bone, the humerus, 
which is similar to the upper arm of a mammal, is hollow instead of solid. It also connects to 
the bird’s air sac system, which, in turn, connects to its lungs. The powerful flight muscles of the 
shoulder attach to the keel, a special ridge of bone that runs down the center of the wide sternum, 
or breastbone. The tail feathers are used for steering.Birds have a unique digestive system that allows
them to eat when they can—usually on the fly—and digest later. They use their beaks to grab and
swallow food. Even the way a bird reproduces is related to flight. Instead of carrying the extra
weight of developing young inside their bodies, they lay eggs and incubate them in a nest.

<h4>Panda</h4> 
<p>The giant panda has an insatiable appetite for bamboo.
A typical animal eats half the day—a full 12 out of every 24 hours—and relieves itself dozens of times a day.
It takes 28 pounds of bamboo to satisfy a giant panda's daily dietary needs, and it hungrily plucks the 
stalks with elongated wrist bones that function rather like thumbs. Pandas will sometimes eat birds or 
rodents as well.Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China. These high bamboo 
forests are cool and wet—just as pandas like it. They may climb as high as 13,000 feet to feed on higher 
slopes in the summer season.Pandas are often seen eating in a relaxed sitting posture, with their hind legs 
stretched out before them. They may appear sedentary, but they are skilled tree-climbers and efficient 
swimmers. Giant pandas are solitary. They have a highly developed sense of smell that males use to avoid 
each other and to find females for mating in the spring. After a five-month pregnancy, females give birth 
to a cub or two, though they cannot care for both twins. The blind infants weigh only 5 ounces at birth and 
cannot crawl until they reach three months of age. They are born white, and develop their much loved coloring 
later. Improved conservation efforts and better survey methods show an increase in the wild panda population.
Hundreds more pandas live in breeding centers and zoos, where they are always among the most popular
 attractions. Much of what we know about pandas comes from studying these zoo animals, because their 
 wild cousins are so rare and elusive.

<h4>Elephant</h4> 
<p>An adult African elephant's trunk is about seven feet (two meters) long! It's actually an elongated nose 
and upper lip. Like most noses, trunks are for smelling.When an elephant drinks, it sucks as much as 2 gallons
(7.5 liters) of water into its trunk at a time. Then it curls its trunk under, sticks the tip of its trunk 
into its mouth, and blows. Out comes the water, right down the elephant's throat. Since African elephants 
live where the sun is usually blazing hot, they use their trunks to help them keep cool. First they squirt 
a trunkful of cool water over their bodies. Then they often follow that with a sprinkling of dust to create
a protective layer of dirt on their skin. Elephants pick up and spray dust the same way they do water—with
their trunks.Elephants also use their trunks as snorkels when they wade in deep water. An elephant's trunk 
is controlled by many muscles. Two fingerlike parts on the tip of the trunk allow the elephant to perform
delicate maneuvers such as picking a berry from the ground or plucking a single leaf off a tree. Elephants 
can also use its trunk to grasp an entire tree branch and pull it down to its mouth and to yank up clumps of 
grasses and shove the greenery into their mouths.When an elephant gets a whiff of something interesting, 
it sniffs the air with its trunk raised up like a submarine periscope. If threatened, an elephant will also 
use its trunk to make loud trumpeting noises as a warning.Elephants are social creatures. They sometimes hug 
by wrapping their trunks together in displays of greeting and affection. Elephants also use their trunks to 
help lift or nudge an elephant calf over an obstacle, to rescue a fellow elephant stuck in mud, or to gently 
raise a newborn elephant to its feet. And just as a human baby sucks its thumb, an elephant calf often sucks 
its trunk for comfort. One elephant can eat 300 pounds (136 kilograms) of food in one day.People hunt 
elephants mainly for their ivory tusks. Adult females and young travel in herds, while adult males generally 
travel alone or in groups of their own.

<h4>Giraffe</h4> 
<p>Giraffes grow about 4 feet (1.2 meters) in their first year of life. A newborn giraffe is about 6 feet 
(1.9 meters) tall at birth and weighs about 150 pounds (68 kilograms).Many young giraffes, called calves, 
die from lion attacks during their first year of life. Once a giraffe reaches adulthood its height is often 
enough to protect it from lions. Adult giraffes, however, must still be careful of lions when they are 
bending down to drink water or rest. Usually giraffes will drink or rest in shifts so that at least one 
giraffe is always on the lookout for approaching predators.​The giraffes' height and excellent vision give 
them a wide view of the grasslands where they live, making it easy to spot predators from a distance. 
Some scientists believe that other animals—such as zebras, antelope, and wildebeests—often congregate near 
giraffes to take advantage of their ability to see danger from a distance. The giraffe could be considered 
the early warning system of the African grasslands.The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging 
to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. 
Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.
